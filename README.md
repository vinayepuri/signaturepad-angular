# Angular2-SignaturePad Demo
This project is a demonstration of how to use the angular2-signaturepad library in an Angular application. It provides an example of integrating a signature pad into your Angular project.

## Overview
The key steps to incorporate the **angular2-signaturepad** library into your Angular project are as follows:

**Import SignaturePadModule**: Ensure you import the SignaturePadModule into your main NgModule. This module is required to use the signature pad component.

**Create a Form Component**: Develop a form component that serves as a ControlValueAccessor for the SignaturePad. This component will act as a bridge between the signature pad and your Angular forms.

**Integrate the Form Component**: Add the form component created above to your main app component. This allows you to leverage the signature pad within your application's UI.

# Installation and Running

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/vinayepuri/signaturepad-angular.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:


cd angular2-signaturepad-demo

3.Install dependencies:

npm install

4.Start the development server:

npm start

This will compile and serve the Angular application. You can then access it in your web browser at http://localhost:4200.

## Usage
Describe how to use the signature pad in your application. Provide instructions on how users can interact with the pad, clear their signatures, and save them. Include code snippets or examples if necessary.

## Demo
Consider providing a link to a live demo of your application if it's hosted online. This allows users to quickly see the signature pad in action.
